        <h1>About Me:</h1>
       <h4>I am ex Air Force security forces; have been a server while I was in school and for a little bit afterwards. I have also done extensive home remodeling working with a team to renovate foreclosed homes. 
           I am very excited to embark on this new journey and to learn everything I can to make me a great developer. Apart from an introductory html course
           from the flatiron school I am near completion in a comprehensive 3 month program at the eleven fifty academy for c# agile api's and others. Upon completion of this program I intend to learn the fundamentals of 
           javascript and ruby and start my journey from there.
